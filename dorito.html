            <h2>Grab your chance</h2>
            <p>You know what happiness says? STOP AVOIDING ME. And you know why? Because we just can't seem to grasp our reasons for living and hold on to them. I have run out of things to say. So um, I guess that's it. Um, please reach out to anyone you want to, that's the only thing that matters.</p>

        <div id="purr" class="float shadow">
            <h2>Donuts with Love</h2>
            <p>The shape of donuts is beautiful, isn't it? Imagine e round donut with coffee cream on the top, chocolate in the middle and maybe some sugar underneath. And a cup of capuccino on the side of the table. The donut and the capuccino, with love. Do we really need anything else on a friday morning?</p>

            <h2>Waffles or Pancakes?</h2>
            <p>Two sweet dishes diverged into a breakfast and I took the one my heart desired. On the rocky road is the crunchy waffles with the hot melting chocolate on top of it, and on the soft earth of the second road are pancakes so mellow that could just disappear in your mouth. So I say fellas, let's spilt up, travler both and share the yummy goodies.</p>
